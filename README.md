# Map-Select-Roblox
A really basic map selection for your Roblox game.

I'll explain how this works.

So basically this isn't a map voting system, the script selects a random (RNG) map from the "Maps" folder when a server starts, meaning that maps may vary depending on the server, so if you want a specific map to be selected, you just need to be lucky.

How to set up:

 1. Make a script and copy and paste the code.
 2. Make a folder in ServerScriptService and name it "Map Select".
 3. Drag the script into the "Map Select" folder.
 4. Make a folder in ServerStorage and name it "Maps".
 5. Now make a map and group it as a model, name it however you want.
 6. Drag the model (your map) into "Maps".
 7. That's pretty much it, you can add more as you wish.
